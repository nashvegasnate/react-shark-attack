## Description
Shark Attack is an app that brings out the sadist in you! It lets you click a button to release a shark to randomly attack one of your classmates, resulting in their arrival in the graveyard below.

## User Story
On app load, the user will see a tank full of his/her classmates just beneath a button labeled "shark attack!". Once that button is clicked, a student is randomly selected for consumption by one of the sharks in the tank. That unlucky person's card is then diplayed in the graveyard following their demise.
